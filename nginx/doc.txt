## Helper for OpenSSL
Create the Password File Using the OpenSSL Utilities  (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-password-authentication-with-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04)

   	If you have OpenSSL installed on your server, you can create a password file with no additional packages. We will create a hidden file called .htpasswd in the /etc/nginx configuration directory to store our username and password combinations.

	You can add a username to the file using this command. We are using sammy as our username, but you can use whatever name you'd like:

- sudo sh -c "echo -n 'sammy:' >> /etc/nginx/.htpasswd"
	Next, add an encrypted password entry for the username by typing:

- sudo sh -c "openssl passwd -apr1 >> /etc/nginx/.htpasswd"
 	You can repeat this process for additional usernames. You can see how the usernames and encrypted passwords are stored within the file by typing:

	cat /etc/nginx/.htpasswd
	Output
	sammy:$apr1$wI1/T0nB$jEKuTJHkTOOWkopnXqC1d1
